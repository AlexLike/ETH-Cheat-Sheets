# ETH CS Cheat Sheets

During my studies of Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I frequently write cheat sheets to accompany me during open-book examinations or to aid my memory when the manuscripts appear too ample. This repository contains select pieces, possibly outdated.

- Mathematics
  - [Introduction to Linear Algebra](LinAlg.pdf)
  - [Discrete Mathematics](DMat.pdf)
  - [Calculus I](Analysis1.pdf) (German)
  - [Calculus II](Analysis2.pdf) (German)
  - [Probability & Statistics](P&S.pdf)
- Algorithms
  - [Algorithms & Data Structures](A&D.pdf)
